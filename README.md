# Candy Crush Analysis

The following project was completed using a Jupyter notebook to explore a dataset from the game Candy Crush. It was completed with a tutorial on the DataCamp website. It looks at a breakdown of wins by level for multiple users and the probability of wins.

The notebook primarily uses basic statistic principles and the tidyverse packages (dplyr, ggplot2, etc.).
